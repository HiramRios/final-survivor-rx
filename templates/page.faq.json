Our commitment to excellence begins with our careful selection of ingredients; we exclusively utilize the mushroom's fruiting body in all our products, as opposed to the commonly<br\/>employed mycelium (the mushroom's root system) cultivated with grain.<\/p><p>Our mushroom extracts originate from Nammex, the foremost supplier of organic mushroom extracts renowned for their over 40 years of expertise in mushroom cultivation. Pioneers in introducing organic medicinal mushroom extracts to North America, Nammex subjects their ingredients to stringent quality control measures. Each batch undergoes dual testing for heavy metals, agricultural chemicals, and microbial contamination, ensuring compliance with the highest standards for dietary supplements. Sourced from certified organic mushrooms, either organically cultivated or wildcrafted from the remote mountainous regions of China, our extracts embody purity and potency.<\/p><p>While North America's mushroom cultivation remains scarce due to cost constraints, China emerges as the global leader, supplying over 85% of the world's mushrooms. With a rich tradition of incorporating mushrooms into both culinary and medicinal practices, China stands as the cradle of mushroom cultivation, with shiitake farming dating back to the early 1200s. Notably, China offers 100% organic mushroom extracts at accessible prices, a feat unmatched elsewhere.<\/p><p>It's essential to discern that products manufactured in the USA predominantly utilize mycelium— the mushroom's root system grown on grains—rather than fruiting bodies mushrooms. As the mycelium and grain cannot be separated, these products contain a significant proportion of grain, thereby diluting the active compounds crucial for efficacy. Independent analyses have revealed minimal concentrations of these compounds in such products. Therefore, consumers are advised to scrutinize supplement labels meticulously for terms such as 'mycelium,' 'myceliated brown rice,' 'mycelial biomass,' 'full-spectrum,' 'whole life cycle,' or any derivatives thereof, which indicate mycelium-based products, not mushrooms.<\/p><p>To guarantee the potency and purity of our products, we conduct specific tests for beta-glucans and starch, showcasing the absence of fillers like grain. With us, you can trust that our products comprise nothing but 100% pure mushrooms.\"<\/p>","show_icon":false,"icon_name":"icon-award","icon_size":20,"icon_color":"#545454"}}},"block_order":["faq-heading","faq-0","faq-1","faq-2","question_9UgyTU"],"settings":{"cstm_cls":"","width":"wrapper","columns":"1","bg_color":"","color":"","border_color":"","padding_top":35,"padding_bottom":35}},"section_accordion_group_RHfHJj":{"type":"section-accordion-group","blocks":{"heading_9nhwcQ":{"type":"heading","settings":{"title":"","subheading":"<h4>Subscription
